# ASSISTASK
   A Django Application, used in your day-to-day life. A Small personal assistant, to get your work done with. With the functionalities of Keeping track of your ToDo list, and manage your password, with high level encryption and hashing mechanism. Also allows you to share your files to the public with ease and read others shared files. It allows you to share even large data files. And for the next level, encryption and decryption of files. It takes in any file you upload, throws a key (***which cannot be retrieved***), and allows you to decrypt or retrieve the same file, provided the correct key. It uses Cryptography package for encryption, and the encryption is being done on two levels. So there's no way to crack it, without the key and the file. Alas! URL Shortner, since URL's are always tedious to handle or work with.
